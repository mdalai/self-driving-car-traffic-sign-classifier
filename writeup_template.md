###Writeup / README

You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

###Data Set Summary & Exploration

####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799.
* The size of the validation set is ?
* The size of test set is 12360.
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3).
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43.

####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data ...

###Design and Test a Model Architecture

####1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because ...

Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.

As a last step, I normalized the image data because because normalization makes the CNN model learn better. 


####2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x1 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 32x32x32 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 16x16x32 				|
| Convolution 3x3	    | 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 16x16x32 |
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 8x8x32 				|
| Convolution 3x3	    | 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 16x16x32 |
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout	      	| 0.6 				|
| Convolution 3x3	    | 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 16x16x32 |
| RELU					|												|
| Dropout      	| 0.6	|
| Flatten      	| 8x8x32 = 2048	|
| Fully connected		| (2048, 128)				|
| Dropout      	| 0.6	|
| Fully connected		| (128, 84)				|
| Dropout      	| 0.6	|
| Fully connected		| (84, 43)				|
|						|												|
 


####3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an ....

####4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 99%.
* validation set accuracy of 98%.
* test set accuracy of ?

I started with color image data. I thought it is not necessary to change images into gray scale. As I knew famous VGG and AlexNet models are succeed on RGB images.
* Started with LeNet. At EPOCH 10, Training Accuracy = 0.971, Validation Accuracy = 0.763. Clearly it is overfitting, so I added dropouts.
* LeNet + Dropout: At EPOCH 10, Training Accuracy = 0.868, Validation Accuracy = 0.722.  Dropout works. Let's try on more EPOCHS.
* More EPOCHES to train: At EPOCH 21,Training Accuracy = 0.973, Validation Accuracy = 0.805. Obviously it is overfitting again.
* Tried 16 different architecures and trained 16 times back and forth. Folowings are a few Accuracy Plottings. 
* The common issue is overfitting. Lowest dropout I can try is 0.6. I tried 0.5, the model does not like it. It basically stopped learning.
* This [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r1ZT1nIan5SOhfctdkrXNfES7yOc3hqESByBbwizVCo/edit#) has more detailed training process. Feel free to check it out. 

After trying so many times, I was frustrated. I have to change the training strategy. I decided to work on dataset preprocessing. 
* Convert image dataset to gray scale. This step is **GAME CHANGER**.
* Validation accuracy get to 94% just in 10 steps tranings.
* 20 EPOCHS:


If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
 

###Test a Model on New Images

####1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] 
![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8]

The first image might be difficult to classify because ...

####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| U-turn     			| U-turn 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| 100 km/h	      		| Bumpy Road					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of ...

####3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|


For the second image ... 

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
####1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?
